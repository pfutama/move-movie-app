<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<a href="https://gitlab.com/binar-10-mini-project/team-e">
    <img src="src/Assets/move-home.png" alt="Logo">
  </a>

This mini-project is a mandatory agenda held by Binar academy and Glints for students at Glints Academy as well as for us in batch #10. At its initiation, we were divided into 6 groups, each consisting of front-end, back-end and React Native students which later is expected to produce a work that can be exhibited as a portfolio. This Movieapp is the result of the work of the E team where we collaborated for 1 week to finish as much as we could.


### Built With

This project builds on some of the important elements that have been taught at bootcamp. Some of them are:
* [Javascript](www.javascript.com)
* [React Js](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Reacstrap](https://reactstrap.github.io/)
